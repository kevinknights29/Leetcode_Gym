# 242. Valid Anagram

Link: [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

Example 1:

```bash
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```bash
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

`1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`

`s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Extra

**Follow up**: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
